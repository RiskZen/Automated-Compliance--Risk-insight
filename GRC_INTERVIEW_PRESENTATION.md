## 🎯 Case Study Questions Addressed

### Question 1: Map Once, Comply Many Strategy

**Strategy Implementation:**

Our platform implements a **unified Common Controls Framework (CCF)** that enables organizations to:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Define each control once in the CCF
2. **Automatic Framework Mapping**: Automatically map to multiple compliance frameworks:
   - ISO 27001
   - SOC 2
   - GDPR
   - NIST CSF
   - PCI-DSS

3. **Policy Alignment**: Each CCF control links to internal policies (e.g., POL-SEC-100)

**Evidence Collection Automation:**

The platform identifies and implements automation opportunities:

- **Real-time Evidence Collection**: 85% automation rate
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated log collection, scan reports, system checks
- **API Integration**: Connects to security tools, HR systems, cloud infrastructure
- **Intelligent Alerts**: AI identifies when manual evidence can be automated

**Results:**
- 80% reduction in audit preparation time
- 85% evidence collection automation
- Single control definition across 5+ frameworks
- Continuous audit-readiness

**Strategic Business Value:**

| Traditional GRC | Strategic GRC Partner |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Annual compliance audits | Real-time compliance monitoring |
| Reactive risk management | Proactive risk intelligence |
| Compliance burden | Strategic enabler |
| Manual evidence collection | 85% automated |
| Historical reporting | Predictive analytics |
| Control checklist | Business risk insights |
